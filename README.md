# popular-movies

An Android app that allows users to view a grid of movie posters from popular movies.  The
movie database is pulled from theMovieDatabase API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
A user can click on a movie poster and view a detail view of the movie's information, including
reviews and movie trailers that will launch in their web browser or the YouTube app. Users can also
save their favorite movies to a local SQLite database of their favorite movies.

Your API key should be added in your gradle.properties file for correct functionality.
